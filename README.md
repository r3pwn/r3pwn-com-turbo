# r3pwn-com-turbo

This is a turborepo monorepo which contains the code for my personal website and the content management system that backs it.

## What's inside?

This repo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `cms`: a [PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/) instance
- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@local/payload`: a library holding the Payload configuration, auto-generated Payload types, and supported icons for social links

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd r3pwn-com-turbo
pnpm dev
```

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd r3pwn-com-turbo
pnpm build
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd r3pwn-com-turbo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
